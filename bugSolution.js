The solution involves adding a `keyExtractor` prop to the `FlatList` component.  This prop should be a function that takes an item from the data array and returns a unique identifier for that item.  A good approach is to use the item's unique ID:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' }]} 
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

By providing a unique key for each item, React Native can efficiently update and render the `FlatList`, preventing rendering issues and improving performance, even with large datasets.  If you don't have a unique ID, consider generating one using a library like `uuid`.
