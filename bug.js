This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and improper key extraction.  The key is used to identify each item uniquely, and if not implemented correctly, it leads to unexpected rendering behavior such as incorrect item positioning, layout issues, or performance degradation.  The issue manifests as randomly misplaced items, flickering, or failure to update items correctly. For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' }]} 
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

This code lacks a `keyExtractor` prop which causes the problem.
